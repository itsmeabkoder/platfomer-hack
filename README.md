# ðŸ›  DevTasks: Community-Driven Project with Assigned Tasks

Welcome to **DevTasks**! ðŸš€  

This repository is a **community-driven development project** where **tasks are assigned by maintainers**.  
Contributors (developers) pick tasks, complete them, and submit their work via **pull requests (PRs)**.  

This structure ensures **organized collaboration** and makes it easier for beginners and experienced developers to contribute effectively.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How This Works

1. **Maintainers create tasks** and list them in the `TASKS.md` file  
2. Contributors pick a task (usually assigned to them or self-assigned with approval)  
3. Developers create a branch for their task and complete the work  
4. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** with the completed task  
5. Maintainers review, provide feedback, and merge the PR  
6. Task is marked as **completed** in `TASKS.md`

> âœ… This keeps the project structured and ensures every contribution is meaningful.
